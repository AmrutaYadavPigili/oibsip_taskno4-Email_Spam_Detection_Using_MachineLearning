Task: Email spam Detection with Machine Learning

We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.

In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let’s get
started!
Building an email spam detector using machine learning is a great project! Here's a high-level outline of how you can approach it:

Data Collection: Start by gathering a dataset of emails labeled as spam and non-spam (ham). There are several publicly available datasets for this purpose, such as the Enron dataset or the SpamAssassin Public Corpus.

Preprocessing: Preprocess the text data to extract relevant features. This may include:

Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
Removing stopwords: Common words like "the", "is", "and", etc., which may not contribute much to classification.
Stemming or Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.
Feature extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. This can be done using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.
Model Selection: Choose a machine learning algorithm for classification. Common choices include:

Naive Bayes: Particularly well-suited for text classification tasks like spam detection.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Can perform well with high-dimensional data.
Logistic Regression: Simple yet effective for binary classification tasks.
Model Training: Split your dataset into training and testing sets. Train your chosen model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can also use techniques like cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters of your chosen model to optimize performance. This can be done using techniques like grid search or randomized search.

Deployment: Once you're satisfied with the performance of your model, you can deploy it to make predictions on new incoming emails. This can be done by integrating the model into an email client or a web application.
